## Hi there 👋

We believe in inspiring the students by doing. In this github, you will see what we do, what we teach, and what we breathe everyday. Our mission is simple: train the students for a successful career _(school -> undergraduate -> graduate -> job/research)_ in statistics and data science by doing things that matter. 

## What actually matters?
- 🔭 Non-Routine Problem Solving (undergraduate -> masters entrances)
- 🌱 Data Science Projects (masters -> job/research -> end of life)

## Who are we?
- 👯 We love solving non-routine problems to stimulate our minds.
- 🤔 We enjoy looking for patterns in nasty data, and decipher them.
- 💬 We find 'aha' moments in learning new data science, everyday.
- 📫 We learn, we math, we code, and we build everyday, something.

We are a group of passionate statisticians, data scientists, and researchers, doing what we love to do, and trying to help students do what they want to do: problem solving with data. Judge us by our work, and content. 

## What do we train learners in?

Anyone can join anytime to start learning, solving problems, and building projects. The youngest students are just fresh incoming undergraduates, and the eldest are starting to grow grey hair, with sheer love for statistics, and data science. Inspiring, right?
